#How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing by taking a scene wether that is a picture, or drawing and think of how to implement certain colors, lighting
and color schemes. I googled a lot of OpenGL lighting and color schemes because that helps me paint a picture in the design process

#How do I approach developing programs?

I used a bunch of development strategies like YouTube, Google, teammates, and such. I approached coding by looking at certain
shapes and such and then I am able to copy and paste them and easily re-create another one so that I can easily fly by the process.

#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

Computer Science can help me reach my goal because I am trying to go the cyber security route. I need to learn all different
programming languages. OpenGL is a language that I won't be using but it is good to know because if I want to switch
avenues then I know that graphic design is something I can do.
